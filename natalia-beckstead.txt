Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    inline element does not cause a line break and does not take up the full width of a page, 
    block element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of a page, from left to right

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

    gets removed from the normal flow of elements, placed relative to the nearest non-static ancestor or, 
    if there is no such container, it is placed relative to the page itself. 
    An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and also it doesn't affect flow of other elements.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

    by using box-sizing: border-box;

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    block: <header>, <footer>, <div>; inline: <span>, <br>; inline-block: <img>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

    each element take some space named box. elements can be grouped so it will be like a "box with boxes inside". this space devided on 
    element itself, wrapped into space named padding, wich wrapped into border, and border into margin.
    It's had to control size of actual box by changing all this properties, but we can use box-sizing: border-box; to 
    set up box size and leave the math of other properties to computer.
